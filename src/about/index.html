        <p>hi, my name's sammy. nice to meet you ❤️</p>
        <p>
          im currently a software engineer that works at canal with a focus on
          the frontend. and let me tell you, i
          <em style="color: #fb3636"><strong>love</strong></em>
          the frontend.
        </p>
        <p>
          but i also love a lot more things like: my family, video games,
          clothing, movies, one piece, and so much more!
        </p>
        <p>
          i am a huge believer in a lot of things too. one of those things
          happens to be that we should all be given the power to showcase who we
          truly are on the web! and i believe the personal website is a perfect
          medium for that.
        </p>
        <p>
          im currently in the middle of trying some new experiments out. one of
          them is figuring out ways to make the website > instagram for the
          average daily internet user as their "web homepage". but that's hard
          because of the way things have become. and also because of my limited
          use of time lol.
        </p>
        <p>
          and so, welcome to my forever-changing website. i implore you to
          explore.
        </p>
        <p>enjoy :)</p>
