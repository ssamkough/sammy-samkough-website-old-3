                    <div style="padding: 10px;"></div>
                    <p>ive procrastinated on this for <strong>way</strong> too long</p>
                    <p>im not too sure why (i think i actually do, but that isn't for this post)</p>
                    <p>the feeling that i must depart from instagram in some sort of <em>correct</em> manner - 
                        and to let ppl i know on instagram that even if im not here, they could still reach out</p>
                    <div style="padding: 10px;"></div>
                    <p>but yeah that's basically it</p>
                    <p>if you have my number, you have my number. but if you dont have it or any contact info,
                        you could contact me at sammysamkough at hotmail dot com
                    </p>
                    <p>(im not spelling it out explicitly because spam (i think, idk, i just follow what other ppl do))</p>
                    <div style="padding: 10px;"></div>
                    <p>this is just so funny to me. i never would have thought leaving a social media platform is
                        that big of a deal. but look at me. like, who am i lmao? but i guess deleting posts forever
                        that meant a lot and having created some sort of digital identity on instagram
                         is a bigger deal than i had thought
                    </p>
                    <p>but yeah, ill be deleting all my instagram accounts on thursday, march 24th 2022 (probs at midnight).
                        hope y'all have a great one <3
                    </p>
