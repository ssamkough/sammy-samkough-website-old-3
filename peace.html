            <p>i am peacin out on instagram</p>
            <p>
              ive been off instagram for months now but have yet to delete my
              accounts
            </p>
            <p>
              ive procrastinated on this for <strong>way</strong> too long, im
              not too sure why (i think i actually do, but that isn't for this
              post)
            </p>
            <p>
              the feeling that i must depart from instagram in some sort of
              <em>correct</em> manner - and to let ppl i know on instagram that
              even if im not there, they could still reach out
            </p>
            <div style="padding: 10px"></div>
            <p>...</p>
            <div style="padding: 10px"></div>
            <p>but yeah that's basically it</p>
            <p>
              if you have my number, you have my number. but if you dont have it
              or any contact info, you could contact me at sammysamkough at
              hotmail dot com
            </p>
            <p>
              (im not spelling it out explicitly because spam (i think, idk, i
              just follow what other ppl do))
            </p>
            <div style="padding: 10px"></div>
            <p>
              this is just so funny to me. i never would have thought leaving a
              social media platform is that big of a deal. but look at me. like,
              who am i lmao? but i guess deleting posts forever that meant a lot
              means more than i had thought. or maybe im just lazy. who knows!
            </p>
            <p>
              but yeah, ill be deleting all my instagram accounts on thursday,
              march 24th 2022 (probs at midnight). hope y'all have a great one
              <3
            </p>
