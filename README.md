## Preface 🖍️

- My original website was done in Wordpress which didn't make me happy, so now I'm custom building it.
- The reason I'm making my website is static is for the sake of simplicity and speed. There's no need to utilize extra packages when there's no need.

## Technologies 🕹️

- HTML, CSS, Javascript
